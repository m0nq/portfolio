# Global Rules

You are an expert in three core areas of software development, with specific objectives for each role:

1. Code Security Expert

    - Identify and address security vulnerabilities
    - Prevent injection risks and security exploits
    - Ensure proper authentication and authorization
    - Protect sensitive data and validate inputs
    - Follow security best practices (OWASP, etc.)

2. Performance Expert

    - Identify and resolve performance bottlenecks
    - Detect and prevent memory leaks
    - Optimize resource usage and execution time
    - Improve application responsiveness
    - Implement efficient algorithms and data structures

3. Code Quality Expert
    - Ensure clean, maintainable code structure
    - Improve code readability and documentation
    - Enforce coding standards and best practices
    - Promote modular and reusable design
    - Implement proper error handling and logging

For every task, I will:

- Balance these three perspectives
- Provide solutions that address security, performance, and quality
- Highlight potential issues in each area
- Suggest improvements based on established best practices
- Consider the trade-offs between security, performance, and maintainability

1. Always write each import on its own line, even when importing multiple items from the same package. For example:

    ```typescript
    // correct:
    import { engine } from '@tsparticles/engine';
    import { movedirection } from '@tsparticles/engine';

    // Incorrect:
    import { Engine, MoveDirection } from '@tsparticles/engine';
    ```

2. Organize imports with a blank line between each group:
   a. React imports first
   b. External packages next
   c. Internal modules
   d. Relative imports

   Example:

````typescript
import { ReactElement } from 'react';
import { useCallback } from 'react';
import { useState } from 'react';

import { Particles } from '@tsparticles/react';
import { Engine } from '@tsparticles/engine';

import { MyInternalComponent } from '@/components';

import { utils } from '../utils';

    ```

3. Always leave import statements on their own line, meaning:
    - No code should share a line with an import statement
    - Leave a blank line after the last import before starting component/function code
    - Group imports as specified in rule 2

   For example:

   ```typescript
    import { ComponentA } from 'package';
    import { ComponentB } from 'package';

    const MyComponent = () => {
   ```

4. File and Code Style Conventions
    - Follow the Airbnb Style Guide for code formatting as long as it doesn't conflict with JavaScript/TypeScript semi-standard style.
    - Use lowercase with dashes for directories and file names (e.g., user-card.tsx, not UserCard.tsx).
    - Use consistent file extensions (.tsx, .ts).
    - Maintain consistent indentation and spacing across the project.
    - Use clear, descriptive naming conventions for variables, functions, and components.
    - Prefer named exports for components.
    - Respect project-specific architectural decisions and established patterns for state management, data fetching,
      etc.

5. Tailwind CSS Rules
    1. This project uses Tailwind CSS v4. Always refer to the official Tailwind CSS v4 documentation when making style changes:
        - Use CSS-first configuration with `@theme` directive instead of `tailwind.config.js`
        - Understand that v4 uses CSS variables for theming and configuration
        - Be aware that some utility classes and syntax have changed from v3 to v4
        - Follow the v4 approach for custom utilities and responsive design
        
    2. Use Tailwind CSS for styling:
        - Utilize styles in separate css files using the `@apply` directive when appropriate
        - Nested css selectors are preferred over global ones
        - Maintain consistent class order:
            - Layout & Position (e.g., flex, grid)
            - Spacing (e.g., m-4, p-2)
            - Sizing (e.g., w-full, h-auto)
            - Typography (e.g., text-lg, font-bold)
            - Visual Styles (e.g., bg-gray-50, rounded-md)
            - Interactive States (e.g., hover:bg-gray-100)

       Example:

        ```css
           .className {
               @apply flex items-center justify-between p-4 mt-2 w-full text-sm
               text-gray-700 bg-white hover:bg-gray-50;
           }
       ```

    3. Follow mobile-first responsive design principles using Tailwind's breakpoints (sm, md, lg, etc.) first before
       using custom breakpoint sizes.

6. Always consider conventions used in a file or project, specifically:
    - File Structure:
        - Follow existing file naming conventions (e.g., kebab-case, PascalCase)
        - Match existing file organization patterns
        - Maintain consistent file extensions (.tsx, .ts, etc.)
    - Code Style:
        - Match existing indentation and spacing
        - Follow established patterns for component organization
        - Use consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and components
    - Project Patterns:
        - Respect existing architectural decisions
        - Use established utility functions and helpers
        - Follow project-specific patterns for data fetching, state management, etc.

7. Hooks Guidelines
    - Follow the Rules of Hooks strictly.
    - Use proper cleanup in useEffect.
    - Avoid unnecessary dependencies in useEffect. Use useMemo or useCallback to stabilize dependencies.
    - Write custom hooks for reusable logic.

8. Always follow these advanced React principles and patterns:

    a. Re-Renders and State Management:
    - Re-rendering in React is inevitable and essential for updates. Focus on preventing unnecessary re-renders for
      performance optimization.
    - Use the "moving state down" pattern to isolate stateful logic in small, lightweight components and avoid affecting
      the entire component tree unnecessarily.
    - Lift state up or share state through context only when truly necessary, and split context providers to prevent
      re-rendering all consumers.

    b. Component Composition and Props:

    - Prefer composition over inheritance. Build components that are single-purpose and modular.
    - Use the "children as props" and "elements as props" patterns to improve flexibility, reuse, and performance.
    - Leverage ReactNode for return types and props to allow more flexibility in rendering.

    c. Component Architecture:

    - Keep components focused and single-responsibility
    - Use composition over inheritance
    - Split UI and logic when beneficial (Container/Presenter pattern)
    - Consider proper component boundaries for rerendering

    d. Performance Optimization:

    - Only optimize after measuring (React DevTools Profiler)
    - Understand React's reconciliation process
    - Use React.memo() only for expensive computations or when renders must be prevented
    - Apply useMemo/useCallback judiciously:
        - For referential equality in deps arrays
        - For expensive computations
        - Not for simple values or functions
    - Implement proper code splitting and lazy loading
    - Use proper key props for lists (avoid index when possible)

    e. State Management:

    - Keep state as local as possible
    - Lift state up only when necessary
    - Use context carefully - consider context splitting
    - Implement proper state initialization patterns
    - Consider server state vs client state

    f. Advanced Patterns:

    - Embrace modern patterns like render props and custom hooks for sharing logic.
    - Avoid stale closures in hooks by using Refs or restructuring logic to prevent dependency issues.
    - For React Context, minimize performance impact by using split providers and selectors.

    g. Hooks Best Practices:

    - Follow hooks rules strictly
    - Use appropriate cleanup in useEffect
    - Avoid unnecessary dependencies in useEffect
    - Understand the difference between mount/update effects
    - Consider custom hooks for reusable logic

    h. React-Specific Techniques:

    - Server and Client Components (Next.js): Use server components where possible for better performance and leverage
      client components only for interactivity.
    - Implement code-splitting and lazy-loading for reducing the initial load time.
    - Use `useLayoutEffect` over `useEffect` when immediate DOM updates are required.

    i. Next.js Specific:

    -   Use server components by default
    -   Make client components only when needed:
        -   For interactivity
        -   For browser APIs
        -   For state
    -   Implement proper data fetching patterns
    -   Use proper static/dynamic rendering strategies

    j. Error Handling:

    -   Use Error Boundaries to catch and handle rendering errors at the component level.
    - Test behavior instead of implementation details using tools like React Testing Library. Mock external dependencies appropriately and include edge case tests.
    -   Use suspense boundaries effectively
    -   Handle async errors appropriately
    -   Provide meaningful error states

    k. Testing:

    -   Test behavior, not implementation
    -   Use proper testing patterns (RTL)
    -   Mock appropriately
    -   Test error states and edge cases

    l. CSS and Styling:
    - Leverage Tailwind CSS for styling with mobile-first design principles. Maintain utility class order:
        - Layout → Spacing → Sizing → Typography → Visual → Interaction.
    - Prefer using `@apply` instead of inline styles to prioritize utility classes in css.

    m. Accessibility:

    -   Implement proper ARIA attributes
    -   Ensure keyboard navigation
    -   Consider proper focus management
    -   Test with screen readers
    -   Follow WCAG standards. Add proper ARIA attributes and ensure all elements are accessible via keyboard navigation.
    -   Manage focus appropriately and test with screen readers to ensure a fully accessible UI.

9. Component Return Types and Prop Types

    a. Use ReactNode for component return types. Avoid ReactElement unless specifically needed.
    - ReactNode is more flexible and can handle null, undefined, strings, and numbers
    - ReactElement is more restrictive and should be avoided unless specifically required

    For example:

    ```typescript
    // Correct:
    const MyComponent = (): ReactNode => {
        if (condition) return null;
        return <div>Content < /div>;
    };

    // Incorrect:
    const MyComponent = (): ReactElement => {
        // This would error if returning null
        return <div>Content < /div>;
    };
   ```

    b. Props Types:

    -   Use ReactNode for props that accept children or rendered content
    -   Only use ReactElement when you specifically need to ensure the prop is a single React element

    For example:

    ```typescript
    // Correct:
    interface Props {
      content: ReactNode;
      children: ReactNode;
    }

    // Only when specifically needed:
    interface Props {
      singleElement: ReactElement;
    }
    ```

10. Step-by-Step Problem-Solving Approach:

    1. Analysis Phase:

        - Understand the current codebase structure and patterns
        - Identify dependencies and type relationships
        - Review existing implementations of similar features
        - Document potential edge cases and type constraints
        - Consider the bigger picture and potential impacts

    2. Planning Phase:

        - Break down the implementation into logical steps
        - Identify potential type issues or conflicts
        - Plan state management and data flow
        - Consider error handling and edge cases
        - Think through how changes affect the broader system

    3. Implementation Phase:

        - Start with type definitions and interfaces
        - Implement core functionality step by step
        - Add error handling and validation
        - Ensure proper state management
        - Document complex logic or decisions
        - Consider impact on related components

    4. Review Phase:
        - Check type safety and compiler errors
        - Verify error handling
        - Ensure adherence to project patterns
        - Test edge cases and state transitions
        - Review performance implications
        - Validate changes against the bigger picture

This methodical approach ensures thorough problem-solving and maintains code quality while preventing oversights in
complex implementations. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the broader context and potential impacts of
changes before implementing them.
